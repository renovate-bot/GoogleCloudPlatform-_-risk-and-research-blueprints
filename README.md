## Overview

Financial Services Institutions require powerful computing resources for risk analysis, quantitative analysis, and other data-heavy workloads. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a scalable, high-performance, and cost-effective solution for these requirements.

This solution helps these firms standardize their compute and research platforms on Kubernetes, offering a pre-configured, optimized, and secure environment. It addresses key use cases such as research computing platforms and quantitative analysis, and also supports data analytics, visualization, and warehousing tools to complement large-scale computing workloads. Benefits include accelerated development, reduced complexity, and mitigated risks.


## Use cases

### Risk: High Throughput Compute and Data & Analytics

There are a number of components demonstrating High Throughput Compute and Data & Analytics on Google Cloud.

Risk examples rely on an [unary gRPC service](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#unary-rpc). This service consumes a single protobuf and returns a single protobuf and can be deployed through a variety of mechanisms.

There are some provided example gRPC services, including a [Load Test](examples/risk/loadtest/README.md) example that provides a test harness that can exercise GCP infrastructure (some compute, some IO) and an [American Options](examples/risk/american-option/README.md) example is a Python example using quantlib to calculate American Options.

It is recommended to start with [Load Test](examples/risk/loadtest/README.md) which provides an end to end deployment demonstration and testing framework.

### Research: Monte Carlo Simulations

Run [Monte Carlo simulations](examples/research/monte-carlo/README.md) for VaR on multiple tickers on GKE, review outputs in BigQuery and Perform data visualization in Vertex AI Notebooks

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Project:
    - Project ID of a new or existing Google Cloud Project, preferably with no APIs enabled
    - You must have roles/owner or equivalent IAM permissions on the project
- Development environment with:
    - [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) (gcloud CLI)
    - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (version 1.9.0+)
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You can also use [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com) which comes preinstalled with all required tools.
- Familiarity with:
    - [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
    - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
    - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

### Quota Requirements
- The default quotas assigned to a project should be sufficient for initial testing and exploration.
- For production workloads or larger-scale testing, you may need additional quota for:
    - Spot vCPUs (for cost-effective batch processing)
    - Persistent Disk capacity (for storage-intensive workloads)
    - Monitoring API requests (for observability at scale)
- The repository includes a [quota module](/terraform/modules/quota/) to help request these resources via Terraform.
